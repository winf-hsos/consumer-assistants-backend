Your task is to craft a natural, user-friendly response to a query about our products using the data provided below. A SQL query was executed earlier to gather this product information, but you must not mention or hint at this process in your response. Instead, use the provided details to directly answer the user's query as if you have the full context.

Guidelines:
1. **Natural Tone:** Respond in a friendly, conversational manner without revealing any details about the underlying SQL query.
2. **Contextual Answering:** 
   - If the user's query is broad or open-ended, make reasonable assumptions to suggest products that best match their needs, and provide an exploratory, comprehensive overview.
   - If the query is specific, give a focused and detailed answer using the relevant product data.
3. **Use Provided Data:** Base your response entirely on the information listed below. Do not introduce external data or mention the SQL query process.
4. **Clarity and Helpfulness:** Ensure that your answer is clear, informative, and directly addresses the user's query.

User Query:
{{ user_query }}

Product Data (SQL Query Results):
{{ query_results }}

Please provide your response to the user's query based on the details above.
