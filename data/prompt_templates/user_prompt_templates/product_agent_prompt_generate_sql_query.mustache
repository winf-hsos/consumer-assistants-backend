All products in the database are organic. You dont need to add "öko" or "bio" to the query. 

Use identifer, name or description to get products by name.

Try to be specific where needed. For example if you use "identifier like %vegan%" it will return a lot of rows. Try to specify with other criteria. 

Add a limit 20 to every query to avoid the return of to many entries.

You task is to to generate a SQL query that returns products and relevant information about these products from the database that will likely help answer the user query. Build the SQL query based on the information provided in the user query and the database schema. Note that the customer does not know about the database or how products are described in it, so he might use different words or phrasing than the database schema. You need to understand the user query and translate it into a SQL query that returns the relevant information. Try to combine multiple conditions with OR or use wildcard queries with LIKE to cover different ways the user query might be phrased.

Return only the sql query! No further explanations! Also dont show the three quotation marks and the sql header. Just the plain query.
